> Which of those did you assign yourself, and which of those are you doing to please someone else? Your inbox is a to-do list to which anyone in the world can add an action item. 

- Go to as many Higher-Level meetings as possible.
- When the going gets tough - "Tonight, I will be in my bed."

### Marc Andreessen
- Don't fetishize failure
> Also see Peter Thiel's thoughts on failure.
- The "nerds at night" test
> The question is: What's the hobby? What's the thing at night or on weekend? Then thing get really interesting.
- Always forward
> Forward, like: We don't stop. We don't slow down. We don't revisit past decisions. We don't second guess.
- "Strong views, Loosely held"
> One of the thing I think you want to look for as both a founder and as an
investor is things that are out of consensus, something very much opposed to the conventional wisdom.  
> People everywhere hate changing their minds, but you need to be able to adapt in light of new information.  
- Two rules to live by
> _Steve Martin's autobiography - Born Standing up: A comic's life_  
> **Be so good they can't ignore you.**  
> **Smart people should make things.**  
- Don't overestimate the people in pedestals
> Steve Jobs once said,"Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that **everything around you that you call 'life' was made up by people that were no smarter than you.** And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the sane again."  

### Arnold Schwarzenegger
- "I wasn't there to compete. I was there to win."
> "I am a big believer that if you have a very clear vision of where you want to go, then the rest of it is much easier."  
- Meditate for a year, get benefits for life?
> "Even today, I still benefit from that because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem."  

### Derek Sivers

> _Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger - Peter Bevelin_  
> _Awaken the Giant within - Tony Robbins_  
- "If (more) information was the answer, then we'd all be billionaires with perfect abs." 
- "How to thrive in an unknowable future? Choose the plan with the most options. The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans."
- When you are earlier in your career, the best strategy is to just say "yes" to everything. Every little gig. You just never know what are the lottery tickets. 
- Don't be a donkey. You can do everything you want to do, you just need foresight and patience. 
- **Once you have some success —— if it't not a "Hell, yes!" it's a "NO".** 
- **"Busy" = Out of control**
