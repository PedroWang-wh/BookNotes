# The Power of Habit
## Prologue-The habit cure
- "All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits," William James wrote in 1892.
- Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making, but they're not, They're habits.
- Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.
- There's nothing you can't do if you get the habits right.
