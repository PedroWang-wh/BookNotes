# The Power of Habit
## Prologue-The habit cure
- "All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits," William James wrote in 1892.
- Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making, but they're not, They're habits.
- Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.
- There's nothing you can't do if you get the habits right.

## I. The habit loop - How Habits Work
- Over time, the loop——**cue, routine, reward**; cue, routine, reward——becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become interwined until a powerful sense of anticicipation and craving emerges.
- Habits aren't destiny. Habits can be ignores, changed, or replaces.
- When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.
## II. The craving brain - How to Creat New Habits
- The psychology of human's habits is grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, cleary define the rewards.
