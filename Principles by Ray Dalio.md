# Principles - Ray Dalio

## Introduction
> 1. Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. 
> 2. Try to discover my own principles from wherever I think is best and ideally write them down. 
> 3. Think for myself to decide 1) what I want, 2) what is true, and 3) what I should do to achieve. 
> 4. The **worst** thing you can be is a **phony**.
> 5. Try to question every word and pick and choose among these principles so I come away with a mix that suits me. 
> 6. Make believability-weighted decisions; Operate by principles...; Systemize your decision making.
> 7. **The most important thing is that I develop my own principles and ideally write them down.**

## Part I: WHERE I'M COMING FROM
> Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way. 

- Try to discern the **cause-and-effect patterns** behind the achievements.

### CHAPTER 1: MY CALL TO ADVENTURE
- Great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor.

### CHAPTER 2: CROSSING THE THRESHOLD

#### MODELING MARKETS AS MACHINES
- Visualizing complex systems as machines, figuring out the cause-effect relationships within them, writing down the principles for dealing with them, and feeding them into a computer.

#### BUILDING THE BUSINESS
- It's smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them.
- Money will be one of the things you need, but it's not the only one and certainly not the most important one once you get past having the amount you need to get what you really want.

### CHAPTER 3: MY ABYSS

#### A SILVER ROLLER COASTER
- Timing is everything.

#### FINDING A WAY PAST MY INTRACTABLE INVESTMENT PROBLEM
- The brilliant trader and investor Bernard Baruch said:If you are ready to give up everything else and study the whole history and background of the market and all principal companies whose stocks are on the board as carefully as a medical student studies anatomy—if you can do all that and in addition you have the cool nerves of a gambler, the sixth sense of a clairvoyant and the courage of a lion, you have a ghost of a chance.
- Imagine that in order to have a great life you have to cross a dangerous jungle. You can stay safe where you are and have an ordinary life, or you can risk crossing the jungle to have a terrific life. How would you approach that choice?
- 
1. Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning.
1. Know when not to have an opinion.
2. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles.
3. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.
- Beneficial change begins when you can acknowledge and even embrace your weaknesses.
- You will think you have failed——but that won't be true unless you give up.
- The most important thing you can do is to gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and radical open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success. Then you press on.

### CHAPTER 4: MY ROAD OF TRIALS
- One of the most valuable thing you can do to improve for making decision making is to think through your principles for making decisions, write them out in both words and computer algorithms, back-test them if possible, and use them on a real-time basis to run in parallel with your brain's decision making.
- If you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want.
- **Maturity** is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.
- Most people are more emotional than logical, they tend to overreact to short-term results.
- Bad times coupled with good reflections provide some of the best lessons.
- Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside.
- If something went badly, you hand to put it in the log, characterize its severity, and make clear who was responsible for it.

### CHAPTER 6: RETURNING THE BOON
- Life consists of three phases. In the first, we are dependent on others and we learn. In the second, others depend on us and we work. And in the third and last, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work, we are free to savor life.
