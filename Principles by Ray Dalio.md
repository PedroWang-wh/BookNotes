> 4. The **worst** thing you can be is a **phony**.
> 5. Try to question every word and pick and choose among these principles so I come away with a mix that suits me. 
> 6. Make believability-weighted decisions; Operate by principles...; Systemize your decision making.
> 7. **The most important thing is that I develop my own principles and ideally write them down.**
