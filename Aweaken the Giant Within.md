# Aweaken the Giant Within

## Dreams of Destiny
- I decided to change virtually every aspect of my life. I decided I would never again settle for less than I could be. 
- I learned to harness the principle I now call concentration of power. 
- One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct out focus; we never concentrate out power. 
- The resources we need to turn our dreams into reality are within us, merely waiting for the day when we decide to wake up and claim out birthright. 
- How to Creat Lasting Change: 1. Raise Your Standards; 2. Change Your Limiting Beliefs; 3. Change Your Strategy.
- Changing our belief systems is the central to making any real and lasting change in our lives.
- **In life, lots of people know what to do, but few people actually do what they know.**
- **Knowing is not enough! You must take action.**
